## Case Study Overview:  
Danny is a huge fan of Japanese cuisine, so in the beginning of 2021, he takes a chance and starts a cute little restaurant that serves his three favourite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen. Danny wants to use the information to answer a few simple questions about his clients, such as their visit patterns, the amount of money they've spent, and their favourite menu items. Having a closer relationship with his consumers will enable him to provide a better, more personalised experience for his loyal customers. So these insights can be used to determine whether or not to expand the existing customer loyalty programme; he also requires assistance in generating some simple datasets so that his team can simply review the data without having to use SQL.

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:  
**•	sales  
•	menu  
•	members**  
You can inspect the entity relationship diagram and example data below.

## Case Study Questions

1.	What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2.	How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3.	What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4.	What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5.	Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6.	Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7.	Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8.	What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9.	If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10.	In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

*Bonus Questions* :

**Join All The Things**

The following questions are related creating basic data tables that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL.

**Rank All The Things**

Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.
